This project implements the SlimSerializer extracted from Azos (https://github.com/azist/azos).

It is adapted to enable portable serialization format between older frameworks (namely 4.5.1) and .Net core 2+

We recommand extensive testing of your data structure serialization before using this software. Only use it if the original Serializer from Azos does not answer your needs.
